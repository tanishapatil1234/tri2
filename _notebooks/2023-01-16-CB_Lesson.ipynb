This returns 40 NOT 40.4 since they are both integers going through integer division. Then the value of 40 will be multiplied by 10, resulting in 400. 400 + 1 = 401 which is printed as the final answer. \n",

Integers may be exact within their range but could lose precision, while doubles preserve decimal precision, offering more accurate results despite the potential for rounding errors. Choosing the appropriate type depends on the nature of the calculations and the desired level of precision."
