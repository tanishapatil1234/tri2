## Reflection (Bulleted because who wants to read a paragraph) 
- I need to commit more sporadically
- Work on collaboration and task assignment. Take on the role of scrum master and help my team stay on track
- I want to learn automated deployment more in depth (why deploy with the same commands over and over again if I can just learn how to make a deployment script) 
- I want to work with more complicated APIs like AWS or Github to do some interesting data analysis 
- Maybe something like commits/contributions to predict success on live reviews
- I want to try crowd sourcing data for atleast one project this year
- I want to update my personal website with any cool projects I do in this class
- I really want to do the student linkden project on the side 
- I would like to push myself to explore UI, since I spent most of this year focused on using Spring/Flask/Django for backend
