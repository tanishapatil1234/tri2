## 3. AI Development 
- I have been experimenting with different model types (Logistic regression, CNN, etc. ) I have decided on a CNN type but came to the realization quickly that it would be too time consuming to start from scratch. This is why I am using a preexisting CNN template model and fitting it to preprocessed facial image data. Here is a code snippet of what I have been coding so far. This is far from done and will be my main focus for this week and the next. Plan to have tangible model in two weeks time.
