# Reflection 

## Overall Thoughts 
- I am not too impressed with the score I got
- I believe my main obstacle was time, I noticed myself taking a long time to solve some problems 
- I think I need to improve my understanding of the concept of extending classes versus implementing them

## How Will I Improve
- I will do test corrections 
- I will do research on class inheritance and look back on the student lesson for extra reference 

## Q9 
- My (incorrect) answer: C, (int) (Math.random() * 6) + (int(Math.random()* 6))
- Correct answer: E, 2 + (int)(Math.random() * 6) + (int)(Math.random*6)
- Reasoning/reflection: I had trouble understanding what this question was asking exactly. My answer was incorrect because it is inclusive 1 through 10 which would not lead to a sum of 12. 

## Q9 
- My (incorrect) answer: 
- Correct answer: 
- Reasoning/reflection: 

## Q12 
- My (incorrect) answer: E, true only when x and y have different values
- Correct answer: B, false always
- Reasoning/reflection: x = true, y = false, (x && Y) is false and (x || y) is true so the overall statement is false

## Q15 
- My (incorrect) answer: B, 11
- Correct answer: A, 10
- Reasoning/reflection: My answer is incorrect because the condition is arg < 10  NOT arg <= 10

## Q18 
- My (incorrect) answer: E, 405
- Correct answer: D, 401
- Reasoning/reflection: Division used was not floating point division **

## Q19
- My (incorrect) answer: C, I and II 
- Correct answer: E, I and II and III
- Reasoning/reflection: In condition III, while loop will execute for x having value 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. When x = 11, loop will terminate. Nothing will print.

## Q22 
- My (incorrect) answer: E
- Correct answer: A
- Reasoning/reflection: The nested for loop will iterate over the numbers in COLUMN MAJOR order and 142536 will print. 

## Q24 
- My (incorrect) answer: E, I and II and III 
- Correct answer: D, II and III
- Reasoning/reflection: Choice I will cause a compile error because it has the same method signaure as public void one (int first). Same parameter (one). 

## Q27 
- My (incorrect) answer: A, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Correct answer: B, {1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6}
- Reasoning/reflection: This was purely misread. I meant to answer B. 

## Q35 
- My (incorrect) answer: A, -1
- Correct answer:  C, 5
- Reasoning/reflection: 8 IS in values 

## Q38 
- My (incorrect) answer: A, Returns 1 if the last element in numbers is equal to val; otherwise, returns 0
- Correct answer: C, Returns the number of elements in numbers that are equal to val
- Reasoning/reflection: Since there are multiple elements in numbers, method will recursively call mystery untul every element is examined 

## Q39 
- My (incorrect) answer: D, Alex Bob Carl Alex Bob Carl
- Correct answer:  C, Alex Bob Carl Alex Alex Alex
- Reasoning/reflection: Again, purely misread the code segment
