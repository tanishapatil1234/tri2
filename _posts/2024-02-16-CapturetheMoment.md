## Night At the Museum - Capture the Moment
### A Summary  
Night at the Museum was a great experience for me. I was given the oppurtunity to explain my game, the tools I used, and my new learning. Along with meeting with parents and students to show off our game, I was able to discuss with others and learn about their projects. For example, Tay's group created a ASLrecognizer. This was really cool to see and learn abouto because I am personally interested in AI, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision.

### Feedback 
We got a lot of great feedback on our project. For example, we were notified on the not ideal UI on our one on one battle page. We are planning on making the buttons bigger and changing the sprite sheets to resemble the main game play and map pages. This consistency can add the feeling of a cohesive game. Additionally, everybody was expecting to use the arrow keys on the game and were not happy with the WASD. I am the one who created the key handler files so I will be responsible with changing this aspect.

### Other's Projects
As I said, I really enjoyed looking at other people's projects. Tay Kims project was really fascinating. I was able to discuss technical aspects with him and learn about his process, as I did a similar computer vision detection project last year. Here are some projects from other classes that I also really enjoyed.

Here is a cermaics project made by a friend of mine. It was really cool to see and learn about the process behind making it. The final product was really lovely.

Here is a wall from the 3D animation classes. My coach teaches the class so I was able to learn about the class and their projects from him. 


Here is some more of my favorite pieces.

### Glows:

- Engagement with Audience: The event facilitated a great opportunity for you to engage with parents, students, and peers, showcasing your project and exchanging insights. This interaction likely helped in refining your understanding of your own project as well as gaining inspiration from others' work.

- Positive Feedback: Receiving constructive feedback is crucial for growth, and it seems like your project garnered a lot of positive feedback, indicating its potential and appeal. This positive reception can boost morale and motivation.

- Learning from Others: The event allowed you to explore and learn from others' projects, such as Tay Kim's ASL recognizer and the ceramics project, broadening your understanding of different fields and approaches. This cross-pollination of ideas is invaluable for personal and professional growth.

- Adaptability: Recognizing areas for improvement, such as the UI and control scheme, and being proactive about addressing them demonstrates adaptability and a commitment to refining your project based on user feedback.

### Grows:

- User Interface (UI) Enhancement: While you've identified the need to improve the UI based on feedback, it would be beneficial to outline specific changes and a timeline for implementation. This will ensure that the improvements are systematically addressed and integrated into the project.

- Incorporating Feedback: It's important not only to acknowledge feedback but also to actively incorporate it into your project's development. Consider creating a structured feedback loop where you gather, analyze, prioritize, and implement feedback regularly to continually enhance your project.

- Exploring Diverse Perspectives: While you've highlighted specific projects you found interesting, consider delving deeper into the technical aspects and methodologies of these projects. Engaging in detailed discussions with creators can offer deeper insights and potentially spark new ideas for your own work.

- Documentation and Reflection: To capture the full learning experience from the event, consider documenting key takeaways and reflections. This could include insights gained from interactions, lessons learned from feedback, and ideas sparked by other projects. Reflecting on these experiences can help solidify learning and inform future project iterations.
